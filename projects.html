		<p class="project-text">The UAC Showcase was a variety show with 14 different student organizations, ranging from A Capella, light shows, dance, theatre, comedy, quiz bowl competitions, and games. Each student organization performed two sets. I organized marketing for the show, bringing in over 250 attendees to the free event in the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre at the University of Michigan. I managed the $2,000 budget for the event, and secured sponsorship with creative marketing opportunities mid-event. Throughout this event I managed several stakeholders, including all 14 student organizations, the University’s Center for Campus Involvement, The Tech Shop, and Apple. </p>

		<p class="project-text">Over the past 3 years, I have been a part of 5 different shows with Big Ticket Productions, and taken the lead on 2. This upcoming year I have the privilege of serving as President, where I will hopefully lead 3 additional shows. Of these 5 shows, 4 have been at Hill Auditorium, a historic venue in Ann Arbor that seats 3,500.  Some of the artists that we’ve brought include Rich the Kid, Ceraadi, A R I Z O N A, Electric Guest, Mikky Ekko, Blackbear, Roy Wood$, Jalen Santoy, and A$AP Ferg.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="project-h2">Rich the Kid + Ceraadi</h2>
		<p class="project-text">In the fall of 2019, Big Ticket Productions brought Rich the Kid. I co-managed this show, managing 30 people who made the show happen. I secured unique sponsorship opportunities, and was key in the artist decision making process, helping to bring the first ever female artist to any student-led show at Michigan.</p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="project-h2">Hip Hop Summit featuring Jalen Santoy</h2>
		<p class="project-text">During winter of 2018, I spearheaded the partnership between Big Ticket Productions and Hip Hop Congress, another UM Student Organization. I then pitched this opportunity to the Big Ticket Executive board, securing $5,000 in funding for the event. This free event hit capacity in the University’s Museum event space. </p>
		<br>
		<h2 class="project-h2">Big Ticket Productions 2020 Fall Show</h2>
		<p class="project-text">Although this show was postponed from Spring 2020 due to COVID-19, it was already planned and I played an instrumental part in this process. I spearheaded a new way in which we decide which artists we bring, bringing much needed data into the process to help insure financial security and a successful show. After this data collection, I pitched the artist that we ended up deciding on, and I hope that the Fall 2020 show can take place and is a success. </p>
